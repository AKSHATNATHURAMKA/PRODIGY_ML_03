Cat vs Dog Classification using Google Colab!

Welcome to the Cat vs Dog Classification repository! This project aims to build a robust machine learning model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The entire project is developed and executed using Google Colab, leveraging its powerful computational resources.
Project Overview
In this project, we utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the well-known Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset


Features!

Data Preprocessing: Techniques like data augmentation and normalization are used to preprocess the images for better training results.
Model Architecture: A custom CNN model is designed and trained to achieve high accuracy in classification.
Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations of data distributions, training progress, and model performance using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.


Prerequisites!

Google Colab account
Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning
Familiarity with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
